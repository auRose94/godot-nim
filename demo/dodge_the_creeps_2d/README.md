# "Dodge the Creeps! 2D" with godot-nim

# How to Run

```console
demo/dodge_the_creeps_2d$ nim c src/core
```

And then **libcore.so(dll)** will be created in **lib/**

Then run the following to create the project data (**.godot/**).

```console
demo/dodge_the_creeps_2d$ godot --editor
```

At this point, an error message stating that initialization of the extension has failed will be output. This is a bug, but not a problem. Reloading the project will resolve it.

Finally, execute `godot` to run the game!

```console
demo/dodge_the_creeps_2d$ godot
```
