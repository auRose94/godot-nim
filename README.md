It enable us to work godot-4.x with Nim.

Based on **[godot-cpp 4.1 stable](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp/tree/godot-4.1-stable)**

## How to use

See **[demo/](https://github.com/panno8M/godot-nim/tree/v4.1/demo)**.

Or clone this repo and execute `nimble debugdemo` to compile demo(test) project and run it.

## Features

This project is in the early stages of development and most features are not yet operational.

### ðŸŸ¢Available
