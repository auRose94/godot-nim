It enable us to work godot-4.x with Nim.

Based on **[godot-cpp 4.1 stable](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp/tree/godot-4.1-stable)**

## How to use

See **[demo/](https://github.com/panno8M/godot-nim/tree/v4.1/demo)**.

Or clone this repo and execute `nimble debugdemo` to compile demo(test) project and run it.

## Features

This project is in the early stages of development and most features are not yet operational.

### ðŸŸ¢Available

* Define your Godot-Class
* Instantiate your Godot-Class from editor
* Override virtual hooks (E.g. `_ready`, `_process`) with nim
* Define and call your **Simple** Godot-Class method at any place
* Define and use your Godot-Class property at any place

### ðŸŸ¡Never tested yet

* Destroy object safety by GC
* Correctly convert between Godot class and Nim object

### âš«In progress

* [ ] Register user-defined methods
  * [x] Register and call simple method
    * [x] access to self instance
    * [x] access to other arguments
    * [x] return value
  * [ ] Support varargs
  * [ ] Support static
  * [ ] Support virtual
  * [ ] Support default-value
* [ ] Get/Instantiate engine object
* [ ] Call engine class method
* [ ] Prepare PropertyInfo template
* [ ] Auto-react to typical notifications
* [ ] Define constants

### ðŸ”´Still can't

* Integrate Nim's ref with Godot's RefCounted
* Instantiate engine class in nim
* Call engine class method from nim

...And so on.

## Development

engine classes and engine variants are generated by **[generator/](https://github.com/panno8M/godot-nim/tree/v4.1/generator)**.
